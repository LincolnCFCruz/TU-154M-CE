  Tu-154M System Viewer / Debug Inspector -- standalone window registration.

  This is a self-contained developer tool. It is instantiated once from
  modules/main.lua (`debug_inspector {}`, right after `panel_windows {}`) and
  does nothing but create its own floating contextWindow. It deliberately does
  NOT register in cw_panels / core/panel_logic.lua and owns no
  tu-154/panels/show_* dataref: the contextWindow's `command` parameter
  auto-creates a bindable X-Plane command whose handler toggles the window's
  visibility (see init/initContextWindows.lua), and `saveState` keeps its
  position/size between sessions. Bind a key to:

      Tu-154/Debug/inspector

  The window content is debug_inspector_view (the tabbed graphical UI), which
  reads aircraft state by dataref name only -- nothing here touches systems
  code, and nothing here creates a dataref (so CLAUDE.md Hard Rule 4 does not
  apply to this component).
